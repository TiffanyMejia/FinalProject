# LaunchCode CodeCamp final project
#
# Overview
My project will be a web page designed for reptile enthusiasts where they can list related animals they have as pets that they want to share. They will be able to sign up, log in, log out, create posts, and view a list of posts by category.
## Features
* *User Accounts:* Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves as well as login afterwards.
* *Create Posts:* Users can create posts, using hard-coded drop-down selections as well as forms.
* *View:* Users can view others' posts as well as view a list of other usersâ€™ posts by category.
## Technologies
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* HTML5/CSS3
* mySQL
### Necessary To Learn
I have a lot of research to do. I will have to learn how to better implement Bootstrap (and CSS), how to use mySQL to store user information as well as website information, and expand my overall knowledge of Java and Spring Boot. I also might need to implement more technologies, and may or may not add more features later such as the ability to delete posts. All of these I must do research on.
